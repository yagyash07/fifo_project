week 1 modules-> 2_ff.v ,testbench.v ,dual_mm.v , dual_mm_tb.v (week 1 had the implementation of dual flip flop synchronizer and dual memory port module



week 2 modules--> top_module.v, tstbench_top.v, wr_ptr.v, wr_synchro.v, rd_ptr.v, rd_synchro.v, bcd_gray.v, gray_bcd.v( week 2 had the implementation of W write and read pointer logic operating at two different clocks , generating empty and full flags by passing data through gray code via a 2- flip-flop synchroniser)


week 3 modules--> asynch_fifo.v,asynch_fifo_testb.v (week 3 had the implementation of the final asynchronous fifo with instantiating all the previous modules created with a proper test bench that shows read,write test ,fifo full and empty condition)
